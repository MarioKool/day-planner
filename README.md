A simple web bassed day planner application. It started off as a refresh to my previous list app, but soon became a full overhaul.

Update: As of 27. January 2020, there is yet again a completely reworked version in work. The updated version will have sweet new UI and better features.

NB! Requires JavaScript to work.

Supports:
 - adding, removing tasks
 - marking tasks as complete
 - shows current day and date
 - mobile layout
 - storing tasks in local storage

Known issues:
 - no tablet or desktop layout
 - missing favicon
 - unable to reload on mobile (fix has been applied, will be in next version)
 - not saving content on Android Chrome on page close (works on refresh) (partially fixed, partial cause of issue is on how Chrome works)
 - not saving content on iOS Safari on page close (works on refresh)
 - highlights on mobile

Coming soon:
 - tablet and desktop layout
 - self-cleanup (delete old tasks from local storage automatically)

 Future updates:
  - addition of favicon
  - possiblity to change day
  - possiblity to create personalised lists
